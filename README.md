# Analyzing-Movie-Reviews
In this project, we'll try to analyze a large data of movie reviews and derive the sentiment.
We cover a wide variety of techniques for analyzing sentiment, which include the following:<br/>
• Unsupervised lexicon-based models<br/>
• Traditional supervised Machine Learning models<br/>
• Neural network<br/>
• LSTM<br/>

Besides looking at various approaches and models, we also focus on important aspects in the Machine
Learning pipeline including text pre-processing, normalization, and in-depth analysis of models, including
model interpretation
